The following code was based on the analyses in:

Beheim, B., Atkinson, Q., Bulbulia, J., Gervais, W., Gray, R. D., Henrich, J., … Willard, A. K. (2019). Corrected analyses show that moralizing gods precede complex societies but serious data concerns remain. PsyArXiv Preprint. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jwa2n

and 

Whitehouse, H., François, P., Savage, P. E., Currie, T. E., Feeney, K. C., Cioni, E., Purcell, R., Ross, R. M., Larson, J., Baines, J., ter Haar, B., Covey, A., Turchin, P. (2019). Complex societies precede moralizing gods throughout world history. Nature, 568, 226–229. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1043-4

Only the following scripts from Beheim et al. (2019) and Whitehouse et al. (2019) were modified. To run the re-analysis, perform the analyses using the code available at https://github.com/babeheim/moralizing-gods-reanalysis and https://github.com/pesavage/moralizing-gods, but replace the scripts there with the following scripts with the same names from here. 

Beheim et al. (2019):

2) explore_data.r
3) fit_revised_binomials.r
4) explore_models.R
